# PyBer_Analysis


## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to first create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. This determined metrics like: Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average Fare per Ride, and Average Fare per Driver. 

The next part of the analysis was to create a multi-line graph to display the trends of total weekly fares by city type. 

These visulizations could then be used in conjuction with eachother to make informed decisions on companies ride-sharing business decisions.

## Results

Below is the Summary Data Frame.

## Summary
 create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type
Deliverable 3: A written report for the PyBer analysis (README.md)
